      <h1>Modern Slavery Statement</h1>
      <p>This statement sets out E-Mall World's actions to understand all potential modern slavery risks related to its business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its own business and its supply chains.</p>
      <h2>1. Our Business</h2>
      <p>E-Mall World operates as an online marketplace connecting customers with various products and services. Our operations span across multiple regions, and we work with a diverse range of suppliers and partners.</p>
      <h2>2. Our Supply Chains</h2>
      <p>Our supply chains include, but are not limited to, technology providers, logistics and delivery services, marketing agencies, and various product suppliers. We are committed to ensuring that our supply chains are free from modern slavery and human trafficking.</p>
      <h2>3. Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking</h2>
      <p>We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Anti-Slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.</p>
      <h2>4. Due Diligence Processes</h2>
      <p>As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we have in place systems to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains.</li>
        <li>Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains.</li>
        <li>Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.</li>
        <li>Protect whistleblowers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>5. Supplier Adherence to Our Values</h2>
      <p>We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. To ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with our values, we have a supply chain compliance program.</p>
      <h2>6. Training</h2>
      <p>To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to our staff. All employees are required to complete training on ethical conduct and human rights.</p>
      <h2>7. Our Effectiveness in Combating Slavery and Human Trafficking</h2>
      <p>We use the following key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure how effective we have been to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Completion of audits by suppliers.</li>
        <li>Number of employees trained on modern slavery.</li>
        <li>Number of reported incidents.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>8. Further Steps</h2>
      <p>Following a review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken this year to ensure that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains, we intend to take the following further steps to combat modern slavery:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct more frequent and in-depth audits of high-risk suppliers.</li>
        <li>Enhance training programs for procurement teams.</li>
      </ul>
